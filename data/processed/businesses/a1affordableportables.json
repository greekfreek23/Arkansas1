Gentleman could not find the tank at first and tried for almost 2 hours.  Was not his fault, we had bought this house (built in 1979) and one of the previous owners had covered septic access with a concrete walkway with no cleanout. He was able to get us in the vicinity of the tank.\n\nAfter having the tank location confirmed with a camera in the sewer line by another local company. Access was gained and we had A-1 come back and pump out the tank.\n\nVery professional and courteous as well.  Would recommend.",
