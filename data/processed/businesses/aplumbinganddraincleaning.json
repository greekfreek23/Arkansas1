When everything froze during the winter and we had a busted pipe we thought it was only a drainage line for gray water, but after further inspection it was a sewage line that was broken and it went way too long without being fixed!!! I really hate that they weren't my first call the first people that came out charged us over $200 to just tell us that they wouldn't start the job unless we signed something saying we would pay whatever they said wouldn't even give us a cash quote the guy's name was Wayne. So we of course did not go with them and went with A+. They charged us $100 to come out and do an assessment The were friendly and professional and willing to help us and was able to give us a quote of roughly $1,400. Well today was the day that they came out and fixed not only would they quoted us on but some things that they saw wrong while they were under there and just took initiative and fixed it! And let me tell you what we were surprised when our bill was only $1,100! The young man that approached me in home Depot that day and handed me the card was Owen. If you have to have anything plumbing done I wouldn't waste time going to anybody else these guys are number one in Harrison for a reason!",

After calling two big name alleged \"Emergency Service Plumbers\" in Branson, both of whom said they could send someone out in the morning, I called A+ Plumbing and Drain Cleaning and their response was that they were on their way.  An hour later, all was well.  If you are tempted to call the big guys, don't bother!  Call A+ Plumbing first!!",
