He accepted a cold call job and was willing to come take a look at what we had going on with our natural gas lines and plumbing lines in the bathroom.\n\nHe was very up front with his prices and explanation of services. He made a smart move by quoting the job as a \"worst case scenario\" which gave my wife and I an opportunity to make an informed decision. He was able to complete the job very quickly and at a reasonable rate per hour, I feel like he met and went beyond our expectations for the service he provided.\n\nHe was courteous to me over the phone, respectful to my wife and great with my kiddo as he watched what was going on. There was no doubt in my mind that he appreciated having the work, and he made us feel like our needs were of utmost importance - which we were thankful for as we are new homeowners just figuring out how to take care of our new homes features.\n\nI would highly recommend him and his services for whatever your plumbing needs may be. I will for sure be contacting him again with any future projects!\n\nThank you, Brandon. God bless.\n\n- A satisfied customer",
