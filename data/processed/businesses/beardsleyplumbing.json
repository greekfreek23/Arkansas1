I called Beardsley Plumbing after reading several comments on Facebook posts that recommended him.  We had only one week until closing to correct the problem.  Mr. Beardsley met us at the house immediately to assess the job.  At that time we noticed that the water heater has been leaking and the pressure relief valve was not working.  We told him to just replace the water heater and add the requested pan.  He called us that afternoon to come see the completed job.  Very pleased with the quick response and professional service.  Mr. Beardsley explained the importance of draining your water heater every two years to remove sediment and  avoid the corrosion that decreases  the life of the water heater.  He offers a very reasonable annual service contract that covers simple plumbing repairs like water leaks as well as checking your water heater and draining it at the recommended intervals.  Will definitely  use him for all our plumbing problems in the future,  highly recommend.  I WILL be getting a service contract with him.",
