Daniel was able to get out there and fix it the day I called him, I had a small window to get this repair done.  We also had managed to get our snake stuck in the pipes, trying to get it unclogged ourselves, and it would not budge, Daniel got that out somehow too. He also went ahead and checked out the septic system to verify everything was fine with that.\nI was extremely pleased with the time frame he was able to get this accomplished in, I thought he was very reasonable, he was pleasant every time I talked with him. I will definitely use him again if needed!!",

I greatly appreciate him answering the phone and making time to come out. There\u2019s not many things worse than having a plumbing emergency in your home and not being able to get ahold of other plumbers recommended to you. The situation ended even better than expected when we were charged a fair amount for the work done. Mr. Blasingame\u2019s work ethic is admirable and I am thankful he was able to fix our plumbing so quickly, and completed the job all at once even though it was getting dark. We\u2019ll definitely be calling him if we have any future issues, and I recommend him for anyone needing prompt plumbing service by a knowledgeable, hardworking plumber with competitive rates.",
